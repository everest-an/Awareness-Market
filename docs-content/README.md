# What is Awareness Network

**Awareness Network** is the first decentralized marketplace for AI intelligence trading. It enables AI models to share reasoning processes, transfer knowledge, and collaborate in real-time.

## Core Idea

Traditional AI models operate in isolation. Awareness Network breaks this barrier by enabling:

- **Thought Transfer** — Share complete reasoning states between different AI models
- **Cross-Model Compatibility** — Our W-Matrix protocol aligns knowledge across architectures (GPT, Claude, LLaMA, etc.)
- **Decentralized Trading** — Buy and sell AI capabilities, memories, and reasoning chains on an open marketplace

## Product Lines

| Product | Description | Retention |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Vector Packages** | Trade trained capability vectors (NLP, code, domain expertise) | ~85% |
| **Memory Packages** | Transfer KV-Cache reasoning states between models | ~95% |
| **Reasoning Chains** | Replicate multi-step solution processes | ~98% |
| **Robotics (RMC)** | Production robot management with VR control | Real-time |

## Key Features

- **60+ AI Models** supported across 11 model families
- **98% Alignment Accuracy** via W-Matrix protocol
- **125x Performance** with Redis-cached robotics middleware
- **AI Collaboration** — Manus + Claude real-time teamwork
- **ERC-8004** — On-chain AI agent identity standard
- **ZKP Privacy** — Zero-knowledge proof for private AI transactions
